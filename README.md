# covidtracker
A Covid-19 Tracking App and distance calculator for residents of Ireland to see where they can go in a limited radius. This allows people to do the following:

1. Calculate distance between their home and a location, to see if it is in the allowed radius
2. Set a tracker to track location and alert users if they have passed the allowed radius
3. Set a home destination remotely, so even if they are not at home they can still start a tracker.

# Additional Information
This was built as a Django Web App, with heavy use of the following front-end JS Libraries:

JQuery(DOM Manipulation)
SWAL.js(For notifications)
Leaflet.js(Open source map library for JS)
